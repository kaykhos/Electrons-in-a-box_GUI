# Electrons-in-a-box_GUI
 N-body electron simulation of electrons on different shape conductors (solves the equilibrium distribution) 

REQUIRES MATLAB 8 OR LATER TO RUN!

Run Controler.m, all other files are aux functions/scripts. The GUI is pretty self explanatory. 

Solves for the electron distribution on different highly symmetric shapes, in 1, 2, and 3D. Matlab GUI to choose shape and numerical solver parameters. Uses a highly damped ODE to let electrons propagate to equilibrium position while the damping removes excess potential energy above the equilibrium value. User has access to final electron position from which to calculate electrostatic potential, Electric field vector, capacitance etc.
